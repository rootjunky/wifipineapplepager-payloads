# Switch Evil Portal (WiFi Pineapple Pager)

This payload allows you to switch between installed Evil Portal captive portals at runtime using the WiFi Pineapple Pager UI.

It presents a numbered menu of available portals and updates the active portal instantly.

---

## Overview

Evil Portal normally serves content from a single fixed portal directory.

This payload works with a symlink-based portal layout:

`/root/portals/current -> /root/portals/<portal-name>`

By updating the `current` symlink, Evil Portal immediately begins serving a different captive portal **without restarting services or the device**.

### What This Payload Does

✔ Enumerates available portals in `/root/portals/`
✔ Prompts the user with a numbered selection menu
✔ Switches the active portal via Evil Portal’s init script
✔ Changes take effect immediately

## Requirements

- WiFi Pineapple Pager
- Evil Portal installed and working
- Multiple portals installed in `/root/portals/`
- A `current` symlink must exist: `/root/portals/current`

---

## Usage (Pager UI)

1. Open **payloads** → **user** → **evil_portal**
2. Launch **switch_evil_portal**
3. Select a portal number when prompted
4. The active captive portal updates instantly

---

## Example

If `/root/portals/` contains:

```text
Default/
google-login/
starbucks-login/
current -> Default
```

Selecting 2 will update: `current -> google-login`

**Note**: In some cases the client will continue showing the prior portal even though the symlink updated correctly. A simple refresh of the captive window will resolve this.

## Logging

Portal switches are logged via syslog:

```bash
logread | grep evilportal
```
