## Features

### 8 Scan Modes

All modes are selected from the **LIST_PICKER** main menu (firmware 1.0.8+):

1. **Quick Scan** - Fast reconnaissance (IP geo + protocol check + SSL/TLS + WAF + tech + WP vulns + info + endpoints + HTML source)
2. **Full Scan** - Comprehensive security testing (all modules including DNS, email security, CT subdomains, CSP, port scan, and more)
3. **API Recon** - Focused API endpoint discovery + CT subdomain enumeration
4. **Security Audit** - Deep security testing (IP geo + protocol + DNS + email security + SSL + tech + WP vulns + CSP + headers + cookies + CORS + redirects + cloud metadata)
5. **Tech Fingerprint** - Identify IP location, protocol availability, SSL/TLS config, WAF, CDN, web server, technology stack, and WordPress vulnerabilities
6. **Subdomain Enum** - Certificate Transparency (crt.sh) subdomain discovery with liveness probing
7. **DNS Recon** - Full DNS enumeration + email security records + CT subdomain discovery
8. **Port Scan** - IP geolocation + nmap port scan + SSL/TLS analysis

### Visual & Audio Feedback

- **LED Patterns:**
  - Blue blinking = Scanning in progress
  - Red solid = Vulnerability found
  - Green solid = Scan complete

- **Sounds:**
  - Scan start notification
  - Alert when vulnerability detected
  - Completion chime

- **Vibration:** On scan completion

### Notification Integration

- **Discord Webhook** - Receive formatted scan results with all CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings grouped by section
- **Slack Webhook** - Alternative to Discord; sends severity summary + key findings to any Slack channel
- **Enable/Disable toggles** - Turn each integration on or off at runtime from the Settings menu without editing the script
- **Optional:** Works seamlessly without either webhook configured — local-only results work fine

---

## Usage

1. Load the **Curly** payload on your WiFi Pineapple Pager
2. Enter target URL when prompted (e.g., `example.com` - no need for https://)
3. Use the **LIST_PICKER** main menu to select a scan mode — scroll with the D-pad, confirm with **A**, go back with **B**
4. Watch results in real-time on the Pager display
5. After each scan a post-scan menu appears — view the summary, send to Discord/Slack, run another scan, or exit
6. Results auto-saved to `/root/loot/curly/`

### Configuring Webhooks & Tokens (at runtime via Settings)

No need to edit `payload.sh` manually. Use the **Settings** menu instead:

- **Discord / Slack / WPScan** each have their own submenu with:
  - **Enable / Disable** toggle — shown as `[ON]` or `[OFF]` in the menu
  - **Set URL / Set Token** — opens a text picker; setting a value auto-enables it
  - **Clear URL / Clear Token** — wipes the value and auto-disables
- **Change Target** — switch to a new target without restarting the payload
- **Timeout** — adjust the per-request timeout (seconds) via number picker

You can still pre-configure values in `payload.sh` at the top of the CONFIG section if you prefer:

```
/root/loot/curly/example.com_20260106_143022.txt
```

Each loot file contains:
- Full scan report with timestamps and GPS coordinates (when available)
- Discovered vulnerabilities with severity markers (`[!!!]` CRITICAL, `[!!]` HIGH, `[!]` MEDIUM, `[-]` LOW, `[*]` INFO)
- Beautiful severity summary box at the end
- HTTP status codes
- Found endpoints
- Security header analysis
- SSL/TLS certificate analysis
- Parameter discovery results

---

## Bug Bounty Tips

This tool is perfect for initial reconnaissance:

1. **Quick triage** - Run quick scan on multiple targets
2. **Subdomain discovery** - Use Subdomain Enum (mode 6) or DNS Recon (mode 7) to find attack surface via CT logs
3. **Email spoofing** - DNS Recon identifies SPF softfail + missing DMARC (common report finding)
4. **API hunting** - Use API Recon mode to find undocumented endpoints
5. **Header bypass** - Identify potential authentication bypasses
6. **Information gathering** - Collect server fingerprints and tech stack info
7. **Sensitive files** - Find exposed configuration and credential files

---

## Technical Details

- **Timeout:** 10 seconds per request (prevents hanging on slow targets)
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Auto-detects or defaults to HTTPS
- **Non-blocking:** LED and sound feedback during scans
- **Portable:** All results stored locally on Pager
- **BusyBox compatible:** Works with BusyBox nslookup, sed, awk (no GNU-specific features required)
- **DNS-over-HTTPS:** Falls back to Google DoH (dns.google) when nslookup results are incomplete
- **Memory-aware:** Large API responses (e.g., crt.sh JSON) written to temp files to avoid embedded device OOM

## What's New in v4.1

### LIST_PICKER Navigation (firmware 1.0.8)

Curly's entire menu system has been rebuilt around the new `LIST_PICKER` DuckyScript command introduced in Pager firmware 1.0.8.

**Persistent Main Menu Loop**
- The payload no longer exits after one scan. The main menu stays open so you can run multiple scans back-to-back, switch targets, or adjust settings — all without restarting.
- Scroll with the D-pad, confirm with **A**, go back with **B**.

**Post-Scan Menu**
After every scan a `LIST_PICKER` appears with:
- **View Summary** — PROMPT showing target, scan mode, all severity counts, elapsed time, and loot file path
- **Send to Discord** — spinner + send + success tone (shows a helpful message if not configured/enabled)
- **Send to Slack** — spinner + send + success tone (shows a helpful message if not configured/enabled)
- **New Scan** — returns to the main menu without restarting
- **Exit** — exits the payload

**Settings Submenu**
A new **Settings** entry in the main menu gives access to:
- **Change Target** — switch to a new URL mid-session; resolves redirects automatically
- **Timeout** — adjust per-request timeout in seconds via number picker (displayed as `Timeout: 10s`)
- **Discord [ON/OFF]** — nested submenu with Enable/Disable toggle, Set URL, Clear URL
- **Slack [ON/OFF]** — nested submenu with Enable/Disable toggle, Set URL, Clear URL
- **WPScan [ON/OFF]** — nested submenu with Enable/Disable toggle, Set Token, Clear Token

Each integration shows its current state (`[ON]` or `[OFF]`) directly in the Settings list. Setting a URL/token automatically enables it; clearing automatically disables it. You can no longer accidentally send to a webhook you forgot was set.

**About Screen**
A read-only nested `LIST_PICKER` with version, description, and author info. All items return to the main menu (B button or any selection).

**Exit Confirmation**
Selecting **Exit** from the main menu requires confirming via `CONFIRMATION_DIALOG` so accidental B-button presses don't kill the payload mid-session.

## What's New in v4.0

### New Modules

**DNS Record Enumeration (`scan_dns_enum`)**
- Full DNS record lookup: A, AAAA, NS, MX, TXT, CNAME, SOA
- AXFR zone transfer attempts against every nameserver (verbose rejection reporting)
- Provider identification for NS/MX records (Cloudflare, Google, Mimecast, etc.)
- SPF record detection in TXT records

**Email Security Check (`scan_email_security`)**
- SPF record analysis — reports strictness (`~all` softfail vs `-all` reject)
- DMARC policy detection — flags `p=none` (monitoring only) and missing records
- DKIM probing — checks 12+ common selectors (default, google, mail, smtp, etc.)
- BIMI brand indicator lookup (optional/informational)

**Certificate Transparency (`scan_crt_sh`)**
- Queries crt.sh CT logs for all subdomains ever seen in certificates
- Deduplicates and probes each discovered subdomain for HTTP liveness
- Reports HTTP status code per subdomain
- Flags CNAMEs pointing to cloud services (GitHub Pages, S3, Heroku, etc.) as potential subdomain takeovers
- Replaces the old wordlist-based subdomain enumeration entirely — CT logs are more accurate and comprehensive

**CSP Deep Analysis (`scan_csp_analysis`)**
- Detects missing CSP header (flags as MEDIUM)
- Checks for `unsafe-inline`, `unsafe-eval` in script/style directives
- Identifies known JSONP bypass CDNs in source allowlists
- Flags missing `default-src`, `form-action`, `base-uri`, `object-src` directives
- Reports total CSP issue count

**Port Scan (`scan_ports`)**
- nmap scan of 26 ports: web (80, 443, 8080, 8443), admin (8888, 9090, 9200, 5601), databases (3306, 5432, 6379, 27017), and services
- Service name identification per open port
- Flags alternate web ports as potential admin panels (MEDIUM)
- Flags database ports exposed to internet (HIGH/CRITICAL)

### New Scan Modes

- **Mode 7 — DNS Recon:** `scan_dns_enum` + `scan_email_security` + `scan_crt_sh`
- **Mode 8 — Port Scan:** `scan_ip_geolocation` + `scan_ports` + `scan_ssl_tls`

### Updated Scan Modes

- **Mode 4 (Security Audit):** Now includes `scan_dns_enum`, `scan_email_security`, and `scan_csp_analysis`
- **Mode 6 (Subdomain Enum):** Now uses CT logs (`scan_crt_sh`) only — wordlist method removed
- **Mode 2 (Full Scan):** Includes all new modules; wordlist subdomain enumeration removed in favor of crt.sh
- **Mode 3 (API Recon):** Subdomain step now uses `scan_crt_sh` instead of wordlist, get better results this way in my opinion

### Slack Webhook Support

New `SLACK_WEBHOOK` config variable. Sends severity summary + CRITICAL/HIGH findings to any Slack channel as an alternative (or addition) to Discord.

### Bug Fixes

- **Cipher Suite display** — was showing the literal word "Cipher" instead of the cipher name (fixed `grep` to target `Cipher is X` line)
- **WordPress readme.html HTML** — was logging raw `<li>` HTML tags; now strips all tags before logging
- **AAAA Records** — was showing CNAME chain hostnames (domain names) in the IPv6 section; now filters to real IPv6 addresses only (must contain `:`)
- **CNAME false positives** — DoH queries returning SOA data or the queried domain itself are now suppressed; trailing dot stripped from results
- **SSRF false positives** — `check_metadata_content` now requires keywords to be absent from the baseline page; eliminates CONFIRMED CRITICAL false alarms on normal Shopify/CDN pages
- **Cookie name prefix** — HTTP/2 lowercase `set-cookie:` header was showing as part of the cookie name; fixed with `awk -F': '` parser instead of case-sensitive sed
- **doh_query Authority leakage** — DoH JSON `"data"` fields from the Authority (SOA) section were being extracted when there were no Answer records; now strips Authority section before parsing (or uses `jq .Answer[].data`)
- **A Records showing resolver IP** — BusyBox nslookup uses `:53` format (not `#53`); fixed filter to exclude both
- **GPS zeros logged** — suppressed GPS logging when coordinates are all zeros (no fix)
- **crt.sh BusyBox sed issue** — BusyBox `sed` doesn't interpret `\n` in replacements; switched to `jq` as primary parser with `awk gsub` fallback
- **crt.sh memory issue on full scan** — 248KB+ JSON variable assignment fails silently on embedded devices; fixed by writing directly to temp files with `curl -o`
- **Discord missing findings** — awk pattern missed `[!!]` HIGH severity entirely; hardcoded section filter replaced with dynamic section tracking
